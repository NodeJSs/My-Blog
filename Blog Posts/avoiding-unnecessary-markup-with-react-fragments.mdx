If you are familiar with React, then you would know that you can only return one React element (which can have children) per component. This can be a problem if your component has to return more than one React element. A common hack to solve this problem is to wrap all the elements in a **div** and return that **div**. This method, however, adds unnecessary markup to your code. A standard way to solve this problem is with the use of React Fragments.

## Using React Fragments

There are two ways to use fragments. The first method is the shorthand method where you wrap the elements you want to return in**<></>** tags. For example:

```jsx
return(
  <>
    <Element1 />
    <Element2 />
    <Element3 />
    <Element4 />
  </>
)
```

Using this method, the react fragment cannot take any props.
The second method is by using a **React.Fragment** component. A similar example to the one above using this method will look like this:

```jsx
return(
  <React.Fragment>
    <Element1 />
    <Element2 />
    <Element3 />
    <Element4 />
  </React.Fragment>
)
```

Using this method, the fragment can take a **key** prop which will be useful if you were mapping over an array and returning components for each array element. Here is an example I grabbed from the React Docs:

```jsx
function Glossary(props) {
  return (
    <dl>
      {props.items.map(item => (
        // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
        <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
          <dt>{item.term}</dt>
          <dd>{item.description}</dd>
        </React.Fragment>
      ))}
    </dl>
  );
}
```



## Conclusion

React fragments help you avoid creating unnecessary markup and you should endeavor to use them whenever your React component needs to return multiple elements.

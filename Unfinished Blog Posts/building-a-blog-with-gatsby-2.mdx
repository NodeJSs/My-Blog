Welcome to the second part of the Building A Blog With Gatsby Series.

In the first section, we built a simple Gatsby site that supported navigation between two pages.

In this section, we are going to create blog posts in **.mdx** and display a post preview for each post on the Home page.

Let's Go! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## MDX

Let's talk about **mdx.** MDX is a file format that allows you to place React components (JSX) in markdown files. That's simply what it is.

Now we will create a folder called Blog Posts in the root directory of our project. Inside this folder, create 3 files with the extension **.mdx**. For simplicity sake, I'll call my files first.mdx, second.mdx and third.mdx. Our project's structure should look like this

```
- cache
- src
- node_modules
- public
- Blog Posts
    - first.mdx
    - second.mdx
    - third.mdx
```

### Plugins

Now out of the box, gatsby doesn't support mdx. We will have to install a plugin to use mdx. Plugins are an important part of Gatsby and they give gatsby extra strength to do more things.

The plugin we will use is **gatsby-plugin-mdx**.

gatsby-plugin-mdx allows us to use mdx files in our Gatsby project.

To install gatsby-plugin-mdx with npm, run this in your terminal:

```
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

To install with yarn, 

```
yarn add gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

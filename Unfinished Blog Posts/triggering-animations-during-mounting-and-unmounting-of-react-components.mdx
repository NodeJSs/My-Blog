Animations help improve the feel of a website and this leads to better user experience. We can use animations during different events: during page change, while scrolling and of course during mounting and un-mounting on components in component-based frameworks or libraries such as React.

In this article, you will learn how to trigger animations during the mounting and un-mounting stages of your React component using React Transition Group.

According to the React Transition Group Documentation, React Transition Group is not a library and I agree with this. It simply exposes transition stages, manages classes and performs other useful functions which make it easy to trigger animations during mounting and unmounting. This "pseudo-library" consists of 4 components, three of which we will use in this article.

Let's get started!

## The Transition Component

According to the documentation:

_"The Transition component lets you describe a transition from one component state to another over time with a simple declarative API. Most commonly it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also be used to describe in-place transition states as well."_

You want to use this component when you need to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component using styling in JavaScript. If you want to use CSS styling, you should use the _CSSTransition_ component which we look into next.

Once again, according to the docs:

_"By default the Transition component does not alter the behavior of the component it renders, it only tracks "enter" and "exit" states for the components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states."_

Now, we will demonstrate how the Transition Component tracks the different state of a component.

First, let's create a new React project. Once that is done, we'll need to install React Transition Group:
With npm

```bash
$ npm install react-transition-group --save
```

With yarn

```bash
$ yarn add react-transition-group
```

Now that you have it installed, we need to create a new component. I'll call mine **AComponent.** Note that I will be writing all my code in one file - _app.js_

Once you have your empty component ready, import the Transition component from react-transition-group.

```javascript
import { Transition } from "react-transition-group";
```

Now that you have it imported, we can now use it in our component. The Transition component takes a function as a child and this function returns whatever markup we want to apply animations to. The function also has an argument called _state_. This **state** argument tells us the present state of our component such as entering, entered, exiting and exited. Now that we understand that, let us write some code.

```jsx
const AComponent = ({ in: inProp }) => (
  <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>
    {state => (
      <div style={{
      }}>
        I am {state}
      </div>
    )}
  </Transition>
); 
```

As you can see, the Transition component takes in two props - an **in** prop and a **timeout** prop. There are other props some of which we will look into later. For now, let's discuss these two props:

* The value of the **in** prop is a boolean(true or false). If the value is in, our component will enter the **entering** state; if it is false, our component will enter the **exited** state.
* The **timeout** prop defines the duration for each transition. You can assign it just one value if you want to set the same duration for all transitions. By transitions, I mean **appear**, **enter**, and **exit**. You can also assign different time duration to each transition like this:
```jsx
timeout={{
 appear: 500,
 enter: 300,
 exit: 500,
}}
```

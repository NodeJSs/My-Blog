Hey Guys!

Ever wanted to build a blog where you can host all your articles without fear of losing them due to third-party problems?

Are you moderately skilled in React?

This article is the one for you

I will work you through the steps of building a very simple blog with a famous static site generator - Gatsby

## What's a Static Site Generator?

According to [this article](https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator), a static site generator takes your site content, applies it to templates, and generates a structure of purely static HTML files ready to be delivered to visitors.

Simply put, a static site generator generates static sites based on the developer's input.

We have a lot of static site generators such as Gatsby, Hugo, Gridsome, Jekyll and so on. In this article, we are going to focus on Gatsby.

## Why Gatsby?

I haven't used other static site generators asides Gatsby but my experience with Gatsby has been incredible. Gatsby allows you to build blazing fast sites with react and the plugins library is **packed.** There's a plugin for almost everything be it optimizing images or rendering MDX files on your site. 

**Fun fact**: My blog (KatanaBlog - this blog) was built with Gatsby üòÅ

## Getting into the code

The link to the repo for the code used in this article can be found [here](https://github.com/NodeJSs/Building-a-blog-with-Gatsby) in case you want to check it out.

Let's get started

Note: You should have Node.js installed so you can use **npm**

Once you have npm installed

**Install the Gatsby CLI**

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

You can now create a new gatsby project using:

```
gatsby new {project name}
```

After the download, open the project's directory and run `gatsby develop` or `npm run develop`

```
cd {project name}
npm run develop
```

Now you should have your gatsby project running at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

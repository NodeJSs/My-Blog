As a developer or designer, having an online makes it easier to showcase your previous work to prospective employers. In this article, I will walk you through how you can build a blazing fast portfolio site powered by Gatsby. This is done with the help of a Gatsby starter I wrote.

Let us begin!

You can find the starter on Gatsby's plugin library [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-portfolio-story/).

To use the starter, install the Gatsby CLI if you don't have it installed

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Now that you have the Gatsby CLI installed, create a new gatsby project with this command.

```
gatsby new {your-project-name} https://github.com/NodeJSs/gatsby-portfolio-story
```

Once you have done that, you should have a new gatsby project with the gatsby-portfolio-story starter installed.
Now you can change your directory to that of the new Gatsby project:

```
cd {your-project-name}
```

Now run this command to get your local dev server running so you can see the starter:

```
gatsby develop 
```

or

```
npm run develop
```

Your server should now be running at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Your site should look like this

The starter uses Emotion for styling and markdown files for the content(your portfolio). It is also a PWA (Progressive Web App) by default.

## Adding your portfolio

Open the **content** folder in the root directory and study the structure of the folders in it. Each folder in the **content** folder represents a previous job or work you have done. In each folder, you have a markdown file which contains most of the information about that job and a preview image which will be displayed on the index page.

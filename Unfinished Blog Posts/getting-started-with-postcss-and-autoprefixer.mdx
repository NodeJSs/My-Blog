PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. According to PostCSS's documentation:

"PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS, support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more."

"PostCSS takes a CSS file and provides an API to analyze and modify its rules (by transforming them into an Abstract Syntax Tree). This API can then be used by plugins to do a lot of useful things, e.g. to find errors automatically insert vendor prefixes."

Put simply, PostCSS takes your CSS code and does something to it. This is done with the help of the various PostCSS plugins. PostCSS has more than 200 plugins such as Autoprefixer which adds vendor prefixes to your CSS and Stylelint which helps you avoid errors in your code.

As you may already know, a Single Page Application is a type of application that has only one page and hydrates that page with new content upon user interaction. Libraries or Frameworks like React allow you to build Single Page Applications and they do so with the help of a router. A popular router for React is the React Router which currently has about 33.8k stars on GitHub. A newer router is Reach Router which was authored by a co-author of React Router, Ryan Florence. 

## React Router or Reach Router?

I'd say the main difference between React Router and Reach Router is that Reach Router comes with accessibility benefits such as focus management built-in. Also, Reach Router looks more elegant, and it makes things like passing data to another route and Nested Routing easier to write.

## Getting started with Reach Router

To install Reach Router via:

**npm**

```
npm install @reach/router
```
**Yarn**

```
yarn add @reach/router
```
